I)Series :(time 16:00)

    1. A one dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type:integers, floats, strings or even Python objects.
    2. Each element in the Series has a unique label called index. It is often used to track changes or pattern over time, such as daily temperatures, stock prices or sales revenue.

II)Dataframe :(time 16:40)

1.  A dataframe is a two dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a table in a database, an Excel spreadsheet or a SQL table.
2.  It consists of rows and columns where:
    a. Rows have indices (labels)
    b. Columns have names (labels)

III)Steps for data exploration:(time:28:10)
1- understand the data set
2- Identify the problem
3- plan next steps

IV)Mean:Arithmetic average of the values

V)Standard deviation:

a. Definition-> modulus of difference between values and the mean.
b. lower standard deviation means data is Iconsistent
c. eg of small standard deviation : 28,29,30,31,32 where 30 is mean
d. eg of large standard deviation : 10,20,30,40,50 where 30 is mean but diff between values and mean is large
